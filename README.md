# Ticker-Predictor

This project uses python to create a long-short term recurrent neural network that projects the value of a stock over a given forecasting period. 

The forecasting over a given stock "XOM" over the past 1000 days, for example, looks like the following:

To use the model, 
1) First, get a AlphaVantage API key and enter the key into the 2nd line of the main function.
2) Then, replace the symbol and forecasting period in the main function.
